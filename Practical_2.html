    <p>Front-end web development is everything involved in programming the user interface of a web application.
        Typically it refers to the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) and JavaScript portion
        of website production as opposed to the database or server-side programming.It encompasses everything from building a simple page
        of HTML text to creating complex, responsive HTML5 website designed to be accessed via various browsers, devices and screen sizes.
