            HTML stands for <i>Hypertext Markup Language</i>, and it is the most widely used Language
            to write Web Pages. Hypertext refers to the way in which web pages (HTML documents) are linked
            together. Thus, the link avilable on webpage is called Hypertext. As its name suggests, HTML is the markup Language
            which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up" a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display.
            Originally, HTML, was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like heading, paragraphs, lists and so forth to
            faciliate the sharing of scientific information between researchers.
