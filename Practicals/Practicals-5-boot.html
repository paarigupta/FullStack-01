            Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web 
            development. It contains CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, 
            navigation, and other interface components. Bootstrap is a free front-end framework for faster and 
            easier web development. It is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, 
            mobile-first websites. It solves many problems which we had once, one of which is the cross-browser compatibility
            issue. Nowadays, the websites are perfect for all the browsers (IE, Firefox and Chrome) and for all sizes of screens
            (Laptop, Desktop, Tablets and Phones).
            All thanks to Bootstrap developers - Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter. Then they later released it for open-source project. Bootstrap includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many other, as well as optional JavaScript plugins. Bootstrap also gives you the ability to easily create responsive designs.
