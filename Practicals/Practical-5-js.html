            JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as 
            a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make 
            dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.JavaScript
            was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement
            being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript.
            The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.
